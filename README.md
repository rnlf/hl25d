# hl25d

HL2.5d is the beginning of a raycasted first person shooter.
rxi and I began work on it during MiniLD 50 in March 2014. The raycaster itself is working quite nicely
by now, but there is not much content yet.

I am currently thinking about picking up work on it again, if you want to contribute, please let me know.
